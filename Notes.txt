    The "Content-Type" header in an API request specifies the format of the data being sent to the server, like JSON or XML.
    The "Accept" header specifies the desired format for the response data, indicating what the client can handle.
    So, "Content-Type" tells the server what format you're sending, while "Accept" tells the server what format you want back.
